        The aim of this study is to investigate how people react in unequal distribution of resources. The existing
        literature points to two different types of reactions. The collective ones when people try to improve the
        position of the group as whole and the individual one when people try to improve their own position. In this
        study we investigate the factors that might affect whether people opt to react either collectively or
        individually.

        This study was indeed an interactive study where you and three other participants made real-time decisions as
        members of the low-income group. In each round, you received real feedback about the contributions of low-income
        members to the public pool and the resulting redistribution of income from the high-income to the low-income
        group.

    <p>However, <b>this study included one aspect of deception.</b></p>
    <p>
        You were informed that you were randomly assigned to either a low-income or high-income group. However, the
        high-income group did not really exist, and all participants were assigned to the low-income group. The reason
        for this deception aspect is that this study focuses on how members of the low-income group react to inter-group
        inequality.
